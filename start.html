        /*WEEK 9 JAVASCRIPT NOTES!

        console.dir()---selecting with this shows the element in console as an   objectthis is helpful to see children/parent/and node information and array index placement
        .querySelector()---selects an element within the html needs to be suplied a valid selector (id, class, element type)
        .children[]---gives access to a child element (element inside the object element; need to include index # in the []
        .parentElement---gives access to the parent or containing element; similar to ../ in termina file paths
        .setAttribute()---creates a new attribute and aplies to the element preceding the . needs to be supplied an attribute type and value for said attribute
        .createElement()---creates an HTML element* needs to be supplied the element/tag type requires appendChild() second step
        .createTextNode()---creates a text node (text content) so it can be applied to elements 
            * needs to be supplied text content / string values requires appendChild() second step
            * needs .appendChild() before it will be added to the page
        .appendChild()---add an element or text node inside of a pre-exisiting element (container/parent) this will allow for the element/node to be added to the HTML aka appear on page
